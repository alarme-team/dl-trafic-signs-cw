# Recognizing Traffic Signs

There are various traffic signs, such as speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, and more. The classification of traffic signs involves identifying the class to which a traffic sign belongs.

# Project Overview

This Python project example aims to create a deep neural network model that can categorize traffic signs in images into distinct categories. This model will enable us to read and comprehend traffic signs, which is a critical task for all self-driving vehicles.

# Dataset

Information We are utilizing the publicly accessible dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign .

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a single-image, multi-class classification challenge with over 40 classes and more than 50,000 images in total. This benchmark has a large, realistic database and welcomes researchers from relevant fields to participate without requiring specialized domain knowledge.
